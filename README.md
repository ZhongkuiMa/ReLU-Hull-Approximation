# ReLU Hull Approximation

## Introduction

This project provides algorithms to calculate ReLU Hull, which is a convex hull or approximation of a polytope after ReLU transformation. These algorithms are used to neural network verification and can be embedded in current state-of-art tool PRIMA in [ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran) project.

## Selective Constraints Identification (SCI)

Here we give a fast, pricise and scalable algorithm, **selective constraints identification** (SCI) and its enhanced version, SCIPLUS. This algorithm get a ReLU hull approximation by selectively identify faces (facets) of the exact convex hull. Our method has more advantages compared to the exact or approximate methods in ERAN (e.g. SBLM+PDDM).

Two types of experiments are given. One is for comparing the approximation precision (volumes of resulting convex hull/approximation), efficiency (run time) and scalability (acceptable dimension); another is for verifying local robustness of a neural network with $l_{\infty}$ norm bound.

## Requirements

Same as [ERAN](https://github.com/eth-sri/eran) project. Therefore, you need to install ERAN firstly and copy our folders in ERAN folder. We put ERAN and ELINA in the same directory, which is different from the default configuration of ERAN. You need to manually adjust a few of our code, or choose to adjust the configuration location of ELINA.

All neural network files are from ERAN project and only `.onnx` files are supported. Only MNIST and CIFAR10 are supported datasets.

## Usage

### Compare Algorithms

Change the directory to `experiment_volume` and run the following command:

```bash
python3 estimate_volume.py
```

You may need to change the specific codes to run the desired experiment.

### Verify Neural Network

Change the directory to `experiment_gpu` (using GPUPoly or GPURefinePoly) or`experiment_cpu` (using DeepPoly or RefinePoly) and input a command like

```bash
python3 experiment.py --net_file ../nets/onnx/mnist/mnist_relu_3_50.onnx --dataset mnist --domain refinegpupoly --ns 20 --k 3 --s 1 --convex_method sci
```

We provide a parser different from that of ERAN, and it has the following main arguments:

- `--net_file`: The network file name/path (.onnx)
- `--dataset`: The dataset (mnist or cifar10)
- `--domain`: The domain name (deeppoly, refinepoly, gpupoly or gpurefinepoly)
- `--epsilon`: The Epsilon for $l_\infty$ perturbation
- `--samples_num`: The number of samples to test
- `--samples_start`: The first index of samples to test
- `--ns`: The number of variables to group by k-activation
- `--k`: The group size of a k-activation
- `--s`: The overlap size between two k-activation groups
- `--convex_method`: The method to calculate k-activation
